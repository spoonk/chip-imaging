Integration requirements: 
- device wrapper that rejects requests if device is busy
-- needs to maintain some status via threads
- wrapper needs a getStatus method for client to ping
- (client side should be completely disabled until a get status returns idle)
- the device wrapper should only handle the imaging + saving side of imaging
- the pipeline can be separate


- try to keep the server code separate, just calling one method in each route


- prepare a demo notebook for the device
- debug stage dying issue


- don't want the device to be runabble if we're stitching, so context imager manager needs to cover that
